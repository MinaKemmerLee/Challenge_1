Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
-	Projects created between the months May and August are more successful compared to those started before or after those months. Sep-Dec having 177 successful projects, Jan-Apr having 188 successful projects and May-Aug having 200 successful projects.
-	The most popular crowdfunding category is Theater, specifically Plays.
-	The least popular category for crowdfunding is Journalism, although all 4 of the campaigns within that category were successful with over 100% funding for each.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
-	Not everyone uses crowdfunding to raise money for projects. 
-	There are projects that are still live that could possibly sway the outcome totals for specific categories.
-	Some parent categories have more sub-categories and more campaigns per category compared to other parent categories; this makes the judgement of which categories are more popular/successful overall more difficult. There is one parent category with only one subcategory that has only 4 campaigns, all of which have over 100% funded rate. While there are some parent categories with multiple subcategories with multiple campaigns in each that have MUCH lower funding rates. It could be said that the one parent category with only one subcategory that has 100% success is more of a successful category compared to a category that has multiple subcategories with varying succession. 
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

-	Country of Origin vs Outcome
        - Would show where crowdfunding projects originate from and compare if they are more successful in some places over others.
-	# of Backers vs Parent Categories
        - Would show how many people are interested in contributing to which categories regardless of success or failure of the project.
